# Slate Design Kit One (React)

This is a react component kit that isn't based in an npm package. What you have to to is: copy the components folder into your project, the tailwind css file and config file, then follow the documentation.

All the documentation for components (and design patterns) is in the [Storybook website]()! (Or in the [Figma file]())

Currently, only light mode is supported.
