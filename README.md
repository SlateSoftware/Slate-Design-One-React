# Slate Design Kit One (React)

This is a set of react components based off the [Slate Design Kit One Figma file]().

We're using Next.js and Storybook to preview and document components. Our tailwind configuration is based off of Next.js 14.

The storybook is also [online](), so you can view all the components and the documentation for them.

## Installation

This isn't a usual UI library for react. For this, all you have to do is copy the components folder from this repo, the tailwind input file (/app/globals.css) then copy the tailwind config file all into your own project. After you do that, run `npm i` to install the packages used for the components, then you're done!
